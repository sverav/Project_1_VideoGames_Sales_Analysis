# Project_1_VideoGames_Sales_Analysis
**Objective: Identify success patterns in video game sales (2016 data) to plan 2017 marketing campaigns.**

Data: Analyzed historical sales (NA, EU, JP), platforms, genres, and ESRB ratings from games.csv.

Preprocessing: Cleaned column names, handled missing values (e.g., "TBD"), and calculated total sales per game.

Key Insights:

PS4 and Xbox One dominated sales; older platforms (e.g., PS2) faded after 5–7 years.

Action and Sports genres were most profitable globally.

Visualizations: Created box plots (sales by platform) and scatter plots (review scores vs. sales).

Regional Profiles:

NA/EU favored shooters; JP preferred RPGs and Nintendo platforms.

ESRB ratings (e.g., "Mature") impacted NA sales more than JP.

Hypotheses Testing: Used t-tests (alpha=0.05) to compare user ratings:

Xbox One ≠ PC ratings.

Action ≠ Sports genre ratings.

Correlations: Weak link between critic scores and sales, but strong for user scores in JP.

Recommendations: Focus 2017 campaigns on PS4/Xbox One Action/Shooter games, tailored by region.

**Achievement: Delivered data-driven strategy to target high-potential games and markets. 🎮📈**

Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy) for analysis, visualization, and hypothesis testing.
